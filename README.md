# Fine-tuning a NER model with BERT for Beginners

This is a basic tutorial to fine-tune a BERT model for Name Entity Recognition.

It is mainly divided in two sections: in the first one, a first approach to Argilla (an Open-source data platform for LLMs) and several of its functions; while, in the second one, we focus on the training of a BERT model for NER using the dataset examined using Argilla.

This tutorial is intended for those who are not very knowledgeable in the subject, but have an interest in it.
